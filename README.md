Task 1: Student Marks Lookup
Description

This program allows the user to check the marks of a student by entering their name. The data is stored in a Python dictionary.

Steps

Create a dictionary stue_name_marks with student names as keys and marks as values.

Ask the user to input a student’s name.

Use the .get() method to fetch marks for the given name.

If the name exists in the dictionary → display the marks.

If not found → display "student not found".

Enter student name: Alice
Alice's marks : 85
Enter student name: John
student not found


Task 2: List Slicing and Reversing
Description

This program demonstrates how to extract elements from a list using slicing and then reverse the extracted list.

Steps

Create a list of integers from 1 to 10.

Print the original list.

Use slicing (list[0:5]) to extract the first five elements.

Reverse the extracted list using .reverse().

Print the results.

Example
original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
